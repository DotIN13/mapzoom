## TODO

1. Cache map download requests in settingsStorage, start transfering when user enters the download page.
2. Double click to zoom in.
3. Use widget animation to move canvas during geoLocation updates
4. If location changes rapidly, store the update as location history. Only update geoLocation if the next update is still close to that location.
